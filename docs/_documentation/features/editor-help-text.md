For people that are new to writing DAX queries it can be tricky to know how to get started with your writing your first query. To make this experience easier we have added some help text that displays when the main edit window is empty. This text will automatically disappear as soon as you start typing or you can turn it off permanently using the tick box at the bottom

There is a link that will take you to a [tutorial](/tutorials/writing-dax-queries) which illustrates some different types of DAX queries or you can turn on the [Query Builder](../query-builder) for a drag/drop query building experience.
