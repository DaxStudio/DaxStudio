The portable version of DAX Studio is distributed as a single zip file. 

To run the portable version you just need to unzip the zip file into a folder and double-click on the DaxStudio.exe file. 

When running the portable version any settings, logs and query history will be saved in sub-folders under the folder holding DAX Studio so you can copy/paste this folder between machines or store it on a USB drive.

> *Note:* The Excel add-in is not available when using the portable install as the add-in needs to be installed in order to be registered with Excel.
